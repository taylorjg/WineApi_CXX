 Spice is Nice
          
 If you've ever smelled a lychee, you'll probably
          recognize a wine made from Gewurztraminer. Gewurz, the
          german term for spice, adequately describes the aromas
          and flavors that permeate wines made from the grape.
          Mostly grown in Alsace and Germany's Pfalz region,
          Gewurztraminer is not the easiest vine to tend. While it
          ripens quickly, it also needs some time on the vine to
          get all of its aromas and acids balanced - which, in turn
          makes it more suitable for cooler climates and constant
          attention. 

 Notable Facts 
 Acidity is the maker or
          breaker of this grape. The distinct aromas and flavors
          give the wine depth and body, but without good acid they
          can be cloying and flat. Most Gewurtztraminers are dry,
          but so heady in aromas and texture, that they can seem
          sweet to one's senses. You'll also notice that the wines
          are deep and rich in color - the skins of the
          Gewurtztraminer are pinkish-red. Other than lychee,
          typical descriptors of Gewurztraminer are roses and
          perfume. It's blend of fruits and acid make it a perfect
          match for spicy food like Indian and Thai.
